# Fashion-Trend-Forecasting
This project was created in semester 4 (2021) as our final project to complete the Natural Language Processing lecture.
Using NLP, my team created a fashion trend forecasting from the rating that we calculated based on women's user reviews on clothing e-commerce we collected from Kaggle.
